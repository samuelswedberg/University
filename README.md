# University Repository

This repository holds all the university labs and projects I have completed so far.

#### ECE 173 - Intro to Computing
Programming in a high level language with applications to engineering computation, analysis, and design.

#### ECE 275 - Digital Design
Introduction to computer arithmetic, designing combinatorial circuits, and designing basic sequential circuits.

#### CSCI 161 - Data Structures & Algorithms
Continuation of CSCI 160 that emphasizes more advanced programming language features and basic data structures. Students will learn to incorporate advanced programming features such as Interfaces and Generics into the programs they develop.

#### ECE 374 - Computer Organization
Organization and structure of the major sections of a computer: CPU, memory, and I/O system organization and implementation issues.

#### ECE 375 - Digital Design 2
Sequential circuit design, design of optimized arithmetic circuits including adders, subtractors, multipliers and dividers, floating point arithmetic, and behavioral and structural VHDL.

#### ECE 376 - Embedded Systems
Use of microcontrollers for data acquisition and device control. Includes assembly language and high-level programming, serial and parallel I/O, timers and interface design.
